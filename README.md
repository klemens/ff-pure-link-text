# Pure Link Text

This extension for firefox allows you to copy the unformatted text of a
link using the context menu. A preview of the text that can be copied
is shown inline.

## Build

The add-on can be built using `web-ext`:

```sh
web-ext build
```

This creates an unsigned add-on. To build a signed version, you have to change
the add-on id and submit the add-on to [Mozilla Add-ons][amo] for signing.
